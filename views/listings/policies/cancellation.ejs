    <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: November 5, 2024</p>

    <h2>1. General Policy</h2>
    <p>
        At Aventra, we understand that plans may change. This policy outlines the terms under which cancellations are allowed and the applicable fees. Please review this policy carefully before making any bookings.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Cancellation Deadlines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>More than 30 days before departure:</strong> Full refund, minus a 5% processing fee.</li>
        <li><strong>15-30 days before departure:</strong> 50% refund of the total booking amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Less than 15 days before departure:</strong> No refund will be provided.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Non-Refundable Items</h2>
    <p>
        Certain components of travel packages, such as flights, specific tours, and non-refundable hotel bookings, are subject to their own cancellation policies and may not be refundable. This will be communicated during the booking process.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Changes to Bookings</h2>

        <li><strong>Date Changes:</strong> Date changes can be requested up to 15 days before the scheduled departure. Additional fees may apply.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>5. Refund Process</h2>
    <p>
        Refunds will be processed within 7-10 business days from the date of cancellation approval. Refunds will be issued to the original payment method used at the time of booking.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>
        In cases of unforeseen circumstances beyond our control (e.g., natural disasters, government restrictions, or strikes), Aventra may offer a rescheduling option or travel credit in lieu of refunds.
